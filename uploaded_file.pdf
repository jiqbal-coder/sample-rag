Sales Compensation Plan Policies 
and Guidelines
A selection of policies from various companies, sales positions, and 
compensation plans
The following is a representative collection of plan policies and guidelines picked from sales 
compensation plans in many different industries.  Policies shown reflect a wide range of ob -
jectives, strategies, and market conditions. They are intended to provide a general framework 
for developing policies, and should not be used without the involvement of a qualified legal 
professional.   
ADVANCES AND DRAWS
[company name] will make its best efforts to ensure that all incentive compensation advanced or 
earned for {xxx}, {xxx}, or {xxx} will be paid in the {period} following the {period} of {order/
billing/shipment}.
All draws are fully recoverable following the {first three (3) months} of employment for new 
Employees.  The following guidelines apply to all levels receiving a draw under this Draw Policy. 
Draws will be paid {monthly} during the {last pay period of the month}.  Draws will be recon -
ciled {at the end of each fiscal quarter} against regular {quarterly} incentive compensation.  If 
incentive compensation exceeds the recoverable draw due [company name], the difference will be 
paid accordingly.  If there is a negative balance, [company name] may charge back the employee 
in the amount of the negative balance.
SALES CREDITING AND CHARGE-BACKS
If [company name] does not receive payment for the {sale, lease or rental} of its products for any 
reason whatsoever, then the Employee agrees that any incentive compensation payments, over -
rides or bonuses he/she has been paid related to those {sales, leases or rentals} are fully recover -
able.  In this situation, the Employee authorizes [company name] to recover such incentive com -
pensation payments by charging them back or by reducing the Employees future salary, incentive 
compensation payments, overrides, or bonus payments, as allowed by applicable laws.Page 3 © Copyright 2010 by the Sales Management Association. All rights reserved.Sales Compensation Plan Policies       Nov 2010
Split crediting:
The following incentive compensation split crediting policy is in effect and may be • 
modified only by approval of {Mr. Acme, Vice President of U.S. Sales}.  At no time 
will more than 100% of credit be made for any order that has been approved as a split 
account.
If in the normal course of business more than one (1) salesperson has impacted a sale, • 
the first common level of management may elect to share the sales credit between the 
responsible parties.  
A request for split crediting should have sufficient documentation presented to show • 
that all sales personnel invested considerable time and effort to win the business.  This 
documentation should include:
a. Call reports confirming contact with the account.
b. Forecast reports indicating that the account was actively being sold.
c. Copies of correspondence and quotations to the account.
d. Proof that an order was placed with [company name]
During the fiscal year, certain programs may be introduced that would utilize this incen - • 
tive compensation split policy to promote the sale of [company name] products.  These 
programs will have a special method for documenting a request for a split and the gen -
eral guidelines for split incentive compensation crediting would be utilized.
Windfall or “bluebird” sales:
The {Vice President} will review “windfall” or “bluebird” sales to determine the appropriate 
incentive treatment.  “Windfall” or “bluebird” sales are defined as one or more sales in a single ac -
count which makes a buying decision with only minimal involvement by the sales employee in the 
sales process.  “Windfall/bluebird” deals with a value of {less than 20% of the annual quota} will 
not be subject to this stipulation.
Teaming Agreements:
Occasionally, it is beneficial to the customer and [company name] that two or more salespersons 
should work together as a sales team.  An approved teaming opportunity will pay 150% of the nor -
mal incentive compensation that would usually be split on a 75%-75% basis.  Only 100% of the 
quota credit will be applied on the same ration as incentive compensation  payment.  For example:  
if a $500K teamed sale is made with two salespersons, they both would be paid incentive compen -
sation on $375K and receive $250K of quota credit.
These opportunities must be identified as early in the sales process as possible.  Teaming requires 
that the sales and sales support personnel from different [company name] sales organizations work 
together to provide the best solution to an identified account.  A Teaming Request Form must be 
submitted and approved by the appropriate sales management and {the Vice President of U.S. Page 4 © Copyright 2010 by the Sales Management Association. All rights reserved.Sales Compensation Plan Policies       Nov 2010
Sales}.  An account would be teamed for a defined period of time and could be extended with ap -
proval of {the Vice President of U.S. Sales}.
During the fiscal year, certain programs may be introduced that would utilize this teaming policy 
to promote the sale of [company name] products.  These programs will have a special method for 
documenting a request for teaming and the teaming policy would be utilized.
Incentive earnings on accounts cancelled due to misrepresentation by the sales employee will be 
charged back regardless of the age of the account.  If the sales employee leaves [company name], 
whether voluntarily or involuntarily, he/she will be responsible for payment to [company name] of 
any pending charge-backs due.  [company name] reserves the right to deduct such amounts from 
the sales employee’s final paycheck.
Pricing:
{Contract} pricing will be based on a range of standard pricing for products, services, and instal -
lation.  {Sales Representatives} may customize individual contract component amounts, but total 
contract price will reflect a total amount within guidelines for the products and services provided.
Early contract termination:
If a contracted deal is canceled for any reason by either party prior to installation, 100% of {book -
ings/sales credit}, incentive compensation, and bonuses will be charged back to all parties paid 
incentive compensation based on the contract.  When a deal is canceled for any reason by either 
party within {six (6) months} of installation, incentives will be recalculated and adjusted based on 
the difference between original incentives paid and revised incentives based on actual revenues 
received plus liquidated damages.
Sales are credited {upon receipt of payment from customer/at shipment/at billing}.
Adjustments to sales crediting for special pricing:
Management reserves the right to adjust incentive earnings for sales discounted beyond standard 
levels.  Management will determine the appropriate incentive treatment in such circumstances on 
a sale-by-sale basis, as appropriate.
PLAN ADMINISTRATION
As a requirement of employment each sales employee must submit a signed copy of the incentive 
plan document, an original of which will be kept on file by [company name] management.Page 5 © Copyright 2010 by the Sales Management Association. All rights reserved.Sales Compensation Plan Policies       Nov 2010
Incentive compensation statement and payment:
{The Finance Department} will maintain a compensation statement for each salesper - 1. 
son which will reflect in detail all credits and debits to incentive compensation account 
and all payments made, including draw, if applicable.
A statement of all {bookings/orders/shipments} will be furnished to the salesperson 2. 
concerned relating to his/her incentive compensation.
An incentive compensation statement will be furnished to each salesperson reflecting 3. 
the incentive compensation status of each {quarter}.  A check for any compensation or 
draw will accompany the statement.
It is the responsibility of the salesperson to report any errors on an incentive compensa - 4. 
tion statement within ninety (90) days of the date of the statement.  No adjustments will 
be made after ninety (90) days of the date of the statement.
Sales-driven incentive compensation will be paid within {45 days} following the close 5. 
of each {sales month}.  Other incentive awards, if earned, will be paid on {the first 
regular pay date} after results are reported and can be confirmed and evaluated.  The 
company may withhold payments or parts of payments that are under further consider -
ation or dispute.  
TERMINATION
The Employee understands that this Agreement does not establish employment for any definite 
term.  The Employee and [company name] agree that either party may terminate the employment 
relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause.
Except as noted below, the Employee shall be entitled only to payment of incentive compensation 
earned prior to the date of termination.
If unearned or recoverable incentive compensation has been paid prior to termination, any monies 
due the Employee at termination (e.g., earned incentive compensation, bonuses, salary, expenses, 
etc.) shall be applied to offset the prior payment of such incentive compensation, if permitted by 
applicable law.  The Employee agrees to repay any previously paid but unearned or recoverable 
incentive compensation that is not offset in the manner described above.  Final payment of in -
centive compensation or bonuses earned prior to termination will be made within 120 days after 
termination.
In the case of termination for either a “Lack of Quota Performance” or “Reduction in Force,” all 
incentive compensation and bonuses on {orders/sales/billings/shipments} booked prior to the date 
of termination and shipped within {60 days} thereafter will continue to be earned and paid for a 
period of {60 days} after termination.  In the case of termination for death or disability (as defined 
in the [company name] Long Term Disability Plan), all incentive compensation and bonuses on 
{orders booked/shipments/billings} prior to the date of termination will continue to be earned and 
paid for a period of {twelve (12)} months from the date of termination.Page 6 © Copyright 2010 by the Sales Management Association. All rights reserved.Sales Compensation Plan Policies       Nov 2010
A Sales Representative who voluntarily separates from the company will be paid incentives 
earned for {the last sales month} employed.
The Employee shall not be entitled to any compensation or claim relating to any sales or potential 
sales not provided for herein.
Exclusions: Any sales of non-[company name] supported product, a specially-engineered or cus -
tomized product not included on the published commercial sales price list or a product sold below 
authorized pricing levels, is not covered under the Incentive Compensation Plan.  The Sales Rep -
resentative may receive quota credit and incentive compensation payments on any item described 
herein, however, the amount, if any, must be specified by a separate schedule prior to the time of 
{shipment/billing] of the particular product and agreed upon in writing by {the Vice President 
U.S. Sales} or designee.
In the event of termination of employment with [company name] for any reason, base salary will

earned, if any, through {the revenue month} of their date of termination.  Incentive compensation 
will be paid during the normal payment cycle.  No additional incentive compensation will be paid, 
or considered to have been earned, by any sales employee after the date of termination of employ -
ment.  Employees who transfer out to the sales organization to another [company name] division 
will receive incentive payments for {two (2) months following transfer}.
CHANGE IN RESPONSIBILITY OR ASSIGNMENT
[company name] reserves the right to reassign territories at any time as it deems necessary or 
desirable in its sole discretion in order to meet management, sales and corporate objectives.  When 
any participant in the [company name] Sales Compensation Plan is reassigned to a different terri -
tory or responsibility, {bookings/orders/shipments/billings/sales credit} in the new territory will 
be calculated as of the date of transfer.  Incentive compensation on such {orders/shipments/bill -
ings/etc} not already {booked/shipped/billed/etc}, as it applied to the old territory or responsibil -
ity, will be paid to the sales person if {booked/shipped/billed/etc} within {ninety (90) days} after 
transfer date.  To the degree that a reassigned salesperson continues to contribute to the closing of 
business in his/her former territory for the {first 90 days} after transfer, orders {booked/shipped/
billed/etc} during this period and {booked/shipped/billed/etc} within {180 days} of transfer will 
be used to calculate incentive compensation.  No other incentive compensation will be paid relat -
ing to the salesperson’s former territory.Page 7 © Copyright 2010 by the Sales Management Association. All rights reserved.Sales Compensation Plan Policies       Nov 2010
